# ML for Heavy-Ion Fusion

This project explores the use of machine learning models to learn mappings
between initial conditions of heavy-ion fusion events and resulting decay products.

## Goals
- Build baseline neural networks using PyTorch
- Understand the full ML pipeline (data → model → validation)
- Apply ML tools to nuclear physics–motivated problems

## Structure
- `src/` : core ML code
- `notebooks/` : exploration and visualization
- `experiments/` : experiment logs
- `data/` : datasets (not tracked)
- `outputs/` : model outputs (not tracked)

## Status
Project setup complete. Model development in progress.
